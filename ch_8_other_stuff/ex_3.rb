# what is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
# exception handling is error handling. It allows the program to catch errors and tells it what to do when it encounters those errors.
# what Ive learned in ruby is it has a 'rescue block' that you can use with the reserved keywords begin and rescue and end to catch these errors.
